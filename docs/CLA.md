# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for contributing to this project!

To keep things simple and legally clear, all contributions to this repository are assigned to the project maintainer, Austin Blass.

This means:
- You keep credit for your work (your name will remain on commits, and you can show your code in portfolios).  
- The project maintainer holds the copyright, so the project can be released, licensed, or updated without complicated ownership issues.  

By submitting a contribution — including but not limited to pull requests, direct commits, forks, patches, or any other method of adding code to this repository — you agree that your contribution is assigned to the project maintainer, regardless of your location.
